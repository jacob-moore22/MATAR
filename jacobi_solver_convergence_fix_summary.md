# Jacobi Solver Convergence Check Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

In the MATAR repository's `tutorial/getting_started/Example2` (Heat equation solver using Jacobi method), one of the solution files was missing a critical convergence check that would cause the while loop to run infinitely.

## Analysis Results

I examined all the solution files in `tutorial/getting_started/Example2/solution/`:

### ✅ heat_1.cpp - **CORRECT**
- Properly calculates `worst_dt` using traditional nested loops
- Updates convergence criteria correctly in the while loop

### ❌ heat_2.cpp - **MISSING CONVERGENCE CHECK** 
- Uses `FOR_REDUCE_MAX` to calculate the maximum difference into `max_value`
- **BUG**: Never assigns `max_value` back to `worst_dt`
- Result: `worst_dt` remains at its initial value of 100, causing infinite loop

### ✅ heat_3.cpp - **CORRECT**
- Uses `FOR_REDUCE_MAX` to calculate `max_value` 
- Properly assigns `worst_dt = max_value` for convergence checking

## Fix Applied

**File**: `tutorial/getting_started/Example2/solution/heat_2.cpp`

**Added line 76**:
```cpp
worst_dt = max_value;
```

This line was inserted after the `FOR_REDUCE_MAX` calculation and before the progress tracking section.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:
1. The parallel reduction operation correctly computed the maximum difference in `max_value`
2. However, the while loop condition `while (worst_dt > temp_tolerance)` still referenced the old `worst_dt` variable
3. Since `worst_dt` was never updated from its initial value of 100, the convergence condition was never met

## Pull Request Created

- **Branch**: `cursor/add-worst-dt-convergence-check-934a`
- **Repository**: jacob-moore22/MATAR
- **PR URL**: https://github.com/jacob-moore22/MATAR/pull/new/cursor/add-worst-dt-convergence-check-934a

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- The Jacobi solver will now properly converge when the temperature changes fall below the tolerance threshold
- Students following the tutorial will get the expected behavior
- The solution demonstrates correct usage of MATAR's parallel reduction operations with proper convergence checking

## Verification

The fix aligns the implementation with `heat_3.cpp` which already had the correct pattern of:
1. Calculate maximum difference using `FOR_REDUCE_MAX`
2. Assign result to `worst_dt` for convergence checking
3. Continue iteration until convergence criteria is met
